    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <hr>
    <p> I’m Daniella Ghonda, a current Computer Science student at the 
        University of Maryland, expecting to graduate in May 2027 
        with a minor in Tech Entrepreneurship. I have a strong 
        foundation in programming, with hands-on experience in 
        languages like Java, HTML, React.js, and more. Throughout 
        my academic and professional journey, I’ve developed a 
        passion for creating practical, impactful projects. During my 
        intenrship at Breakthrough Tech DC, I collaborated on GroceriScout, 
        a website that helps users find affordable groceries in College
        Park. This experience honed my skills in front-end development 
        and taught me how to deliver a product within tight timelines,
        presenting it to a panel of judges. As an Academic Peer Mentor
        for the First-Year Innovation and Research Experience (FIRE) at 
        UMD, I guided over 35 students in launching their research 
        projects and helped mentor five teams. I also worked on 
        exciting research projects, including designing a colorimetric 
        detection device integrated with a web platform, using advanced 
        technologies like React.js. My projects include GroceriScout: 
        Terp Edition, where I developed a price comparison tool for 
        groceries in College Park, and a multi-threaded simulation of 
        a social network for my Concurrency-Based Social Network 
        Simulation project. Additionally, I created a Media Rental 
        Manager application in Java that allows users to track and 
        manage media rentals. I am also ISC² Certified in Cybersecurity 
        and TestOut Security Pro certified, with a growing interest in 
        leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. I’m always 
        eager to take on new challenges and expand my technical skill set.
