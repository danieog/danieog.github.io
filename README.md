# danieog.github.io

My own website I created to showcase a majority of my own projects. 

This was done in my freetime, by self-studying HTML, CSS, and Javascript :).

Version 1.0 (01/22/2025): Created the repo & basic files. 

Version 1.0.1 (01/26/2025): Linked my resume and made a majority of the basic HTML website.
